* Player 1 - 4: players and their Power Ranking points. Player #1 has the most points on each squad; #4 has the least
* Squad Placements: placements for FNCS weeks 1-3, and their average. Squads that didn't place in each week are excluded.
* Squad Rank: squad ranking in each region based on average placement in weeks 1-3 of FNCS
* Players Rank: rank of squads in each region based on the sum of the squad member's Power Ranking points.
* Chemistry Score: difference between "Players Rank" and "Squad Rank." Negative scores means a squad is performing less well than the sum of the team's Power Rankings would lead you to expect. A positive number means the squad is performing better, suggesting the team members play well together, or that the team has up-and-coming players.
