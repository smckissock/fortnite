        <div class="text">
            v 16
            <ul>
                <li>When a single player is selected, show solo, duo and total stats for payouts, points, elims and wins, and thier ranking for each in the player's region.</li>
                <li>Show player's team, nationality and age, when we have them</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            v 15
            <ul>
                <li>Now all players with earnings in the World Cup qualifiers are included, even when their winnings
                    for a
                    given week are outside the top 100.</li>
                <li>When a single player is selected, show their name and total winnings above their results for each
                    week</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            v 14
            <ul>
                <li>If a team is selected, the team's players are labeled and highlighted on the scatterplot. To
                    adjust the positions of the labels, drag and drop.</li>
                <li>Big diagonal text for the week or solos/duos on the scatterplot</li>
                <li>Added a "World Cup Only" checkbox to toggle the player listing and scatterplot between players who
                    qualified for the World Cup and players who finished in the top 10 in any week.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            v 13
            <ul>
                <li>Added a "Show Listing" / "Show Chart" button. "Show Chart" draws a scatterplot of the players,
                    based on what you hose above the player listing. If you click on a filter - region, week or
                    solo/duo - they work the same as they do when in "listing" mode. Mousing over a circle shows the
                    player stats.</li>
                <li>We welcome feedback on this addition. What can do to make it useful, or was it just a bad idea? DM
                    or tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/fortnitestats4">@fortnitestats4</a></li>

            v 12
            <ul>
                <li>Added winnings by team and a way to filter for teams. This only includes qualified players, and is
                    a work in progress. Please DM corrections.</li>
                <li>Changed background from yellow/orange to grey. I like the orange, but everyone else hated it, so
                    fine.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            v 4
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking on a column header sorts on that variable (e.g., payout, elims, etc)</li>
                <li>Colors on the player listing did not exactly match the color of their region</li>
                <li>The first column header switches from "#" to "Rank" depending on whether a week is selected</li>

            v 1
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: this only includes the first 100 solos or duos for a region/week, based on Epic's standings.
                    This means that most player's payout will be understated, and those who have never finished in the
                    top 100 will not appear at all, even if they have winnings</li>
                <li>Issue: nothing has been done to make this work on mobile</li>
            </ul>
